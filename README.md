# Marco Krebs Consulting - Digital Portfolio

A modern, responsive one-page website showcasing strategic consulting services in tech, AI, and digital transformation. Built with performance and user experience in mind.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This is my professional consulting website, designed to demonstrate both business expertise and technical curiosity. While I'm primarily a strategist and advisor rather than a developer, I believe in understanding the tools and technologies that drive modern digital experiences.

- **Lovable** - AI-powered web development platform for rapid prototyping
- **Claude (Anthropic)** - AI assistant for code optimization and technical guidance  
- **Custom modifications** - Personal touches and business-specific customizations

The site serves as both a business portfolio and a practical exploration of contemporary web technologies - reflecting my hands-on approach to digital innovation and AI-driven solutions. This project helped me better understand modern development approaches and the power of AI-assisted development.
